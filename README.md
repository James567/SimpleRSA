SimpleRSA
=========

A simple version of RSA algorithm implementation.

> No voice, but big deal.

### Requirement
Write a Java or C program that demostrates RSA encryption and decryption algorithm.
* The program should support 512, 768, 1024 and 2048 bits key size.
* You are free to use any C++ package or Java class to handle big integers.
* We adapt the convention that Bob is the party who will announce the public keys and Alice the one who will send Bob message encrypted with the public keys.
* You can refer to RSA-Tool and the following interface, and you are encouraged to implement RSA-OAEP(RFC 3447 or PKCS #1 V2.1) or other special functions to demonstrate your work.
* Please include comments in your code, the test files and the sample output.
